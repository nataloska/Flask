<h2>About page</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the
      Mountain King,[1] was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin
      and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin
      was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the
      lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading
      an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.

    <h3>Fili and kili</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set
      out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo
      Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Fíli and
      Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from
      Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual"
      characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who
      were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

    <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
    <p>
      Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The
      Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf
      suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their
      burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five
      Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first
      to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of
      his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his
      second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents,
      Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
      Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one
      of the few to set foot in the Undying Lands.

    <h3>Dwalin</h3>
    <p>
      Dwalin was one of the Dwarves who traveled with Bilbo and Gandalf as a
      member of Thorin and Company on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain
      from the Dragon Smaug. He was the brother of Balin and the youngest son of
      Fundin.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin.
      He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield
      on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord known for his
      wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
      friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant
      of the noble house of Durin. He later went to re-establish the kingdom of
      Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was
      killed there along with the rest of his companions.

    <h3>Oin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and
      later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
      Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Gloin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's
      company who set out to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor.
      He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of
      the Ring. Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character.
      Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring during the Fellowship's
      stay in Rivendell.

    <h3>Dori</h3>
    <p>
      Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and
      cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a
      member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who
      joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
      well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent
      fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on
      the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the
      thirteen companions.[2]

    <h3>Nori</h3>
    <p>
      Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to
      have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for
      regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in
      Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

      Ori was a member of Thorin's Company of Dwarves and participated in the
      Quest of Erebor, as well as fighting in and surviving the Battle of Five
      Armies. He, along with his cousins Dori and Nori,[2] were remote kinsmen
      of Thorin II Oakenshield.

    <h3>Bifur</h3>
    <p>
      Bifur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being a
      companion to Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield on the quest to regain
      the Lonely Mountain, along with his cousins Bofur and Bombur.

    <h3>Bofur</h3>
    <p>
      Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his
      family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly
      about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more
      interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row featurette">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <h3>Bombur</h3>
    <p>
      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of
      Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the
      Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
      between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
      of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured,
      Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born
      in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior
      to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
      Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
      Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Elf of the Wand" or "Wand-elf") the
      Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin
      (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), was an Istar
      (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of
      Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring,
      and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
